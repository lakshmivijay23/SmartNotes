Django is a robust and powerful framework with a lot of moving parts. Although starting a new project can be quite easy, there is a lot to uncover. This course teaches fundamentals, such as what a framework is, what an HTTP request is, and how Django replies to HTTP requests. Software developer and podcaster Leticia Portella walks you through each step of building a working system that can create, edit, and list books per user with an authentication system. Topics include getting started, creating users and data, ORMs, creating a dynamic template, Django class-based files and static views, and so much more!
